# Evaluation and Policies 

## DIVERSE PERSPECTIVES AND LEARNING MODES
Your success in this class is important to me. We all learn differently and require different kinds of accommodations. If there are aspects of this course that prevent you from learning or exclude you in any way, I invite you to communicate this with me. Together we’ll develop strategies to meet both your needs and the requirements of the course.

## BOOKABLE OFFICE HOURS
Due to the format of this is a weekend course, I do not offer office hours. You are welcome to contact me by email if you'd like to discuss a class topic outside of class hours. 


## EQUIPMENT
You will need a modern laptop (4 years old or younger is a good rule of thumb).  Limited numbers are available for checkout from the department.  

## TEACHING STYLE 
Classes will be a mixture of lecture, discussion, hands-on tutorials, and group work. You will need to come to class prepared with a laptop, paper and pencil/pen.

## GRADING 

[ITP]
Pass or fail grades will be determined by the following breakdown:

100% Attendence / Participation

## ASSIGNMENTS 
There will be minimal pre-course reading and prep. There will be no assignments between classes as we will be meeting for two consecutive days only. 

## PARTICIPATION
ITP/IMA is committed to facilitating the fullest possible participation of all students. There are many forms of participation. Examples of modes of participation can look like: asking questions, class group discussion, arriving on time, going to class, taking notes, listening to peers, submitting responses to a form (anonymous or not), following instructions, active listening, etc.

## MAKEUP WORK POLICY
If you miss more than 50% of class sessions, it will result in an automatic F for the course. So if you miss one day of the course you will recieve an F. Please discuss making up work with Lisa if needed, however, make up opportunities are not gauranteed and it is prpreferred that all students attend the full weekend course as scheduled. 

## AI STATEMENT
You should treat AI tools just as you would any other source: cite the source and note how it was used (Harvard has a useful guide to citation of AIs). You should be prepared to explain how your use of it is the appropriate tool to fit your goal or concept and does not detract from your experience meeting the learning objectives of the assignment or course. There are some cases where the use of AI may fall under a form of plagiarism. Differentiate your work from your source’s work in a way that's clear to the reader or viewer. Additionally, you should be prepared to discuss the ethical concerns around the widespread use of emerging AI tools. 

## ATTENDANCE POLICY
After the first two weeks of the add/drop period, effective in week three onward, students are permitted the following number of absences:

1 unit - 0 absences

There are no excused absences and unexcused absences. There are only absences. Any absences will affect your grade. Late arrivals (more than 10 minutes after start time) will count as absence. 

## STATEMENT OF ACADEMIC INTEGRITY
Plagiarism is presenting someone else’s work as though it were your own. More specifically, plagiarism is to present as your own: A sequence of words quoted without quotation marks from another writer or a paraphrased passage from another writer’s work or facts, ideas or images composed by someone else. 

Collaboration is highly valued and often necessary to produce great work. Students build their own work on that of other people and giving credit to the creator of the work you are incorporating into your own work is an act of integrity. Plagiarism, on the other hand, is a form of fraud. Proper acknowledgment and correct citation constitute the difference.

## STATEMENT ON USE OF ELECTRONIC DEVICES
Laptops and other electronic devices are essential tools for learning and interaction in classrooms. However, they can create distractions that hinder students' ability to actively participate and engage.
